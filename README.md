# üß† ESP32 BLE Keyboard

This project turns an **ESP32** into a **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Keyboard (HID device)** capable of sending keystrokes, system, and media control commands to a paired device such as a computer, smartphone, or tablet.

It uses the [`BleKeyboard`](https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard) library for Arduino to emulate a standard Bluetooth keyboard.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Function | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **BLE Keyboard Emulation** | ESP32 acts as a standard Bluetooth keyboard (HID). |
| **Automatic Text Sending** | Sends `"Hello world"` every loop when connected. |
| **Keyboard Key Events** | Sends standard keys such as `Enter`, `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Del`, etc. |
| **Media Key Events** | Controls system media keys such as `Play/Pause`. |
| **Connection Detection** | Operates only when a BLE client is connected. |
| **Debug via Serial** | Prints log messages on the serial console for debugging. |

## üß© Example Operation

When powered on:

1. ESP32 starts advertising as a BLE keyboard.  
2. You can pair it with your computer or phone (shows up as **"ESP32 Keyboard"**).  
3. Once connected:
   - Types `"Hello world"`.
   - Presses **Enter**.
   - Sends **Play/Pause** media key.
   - (Optionally) Sends **Ctrl+Alt+Del** combination.

## üß∞ Hardware Requirements

- **ESP32 development board** (with BLE support)
- **USB cable** for programming
- (Optional) **Push button** or input device if adding manual triggers

---

## üßæ Software Requirements

- **Arduino IDE** or **PlatformIO**
- **BleKeyboard Library**  
  Install via Arduino Library Manager or clone manually:

  ```bash
  https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard

üß± Code Explanation
Main Sections
1. Initialization
BleKeyboard bleKeyboard;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.println("Starting BLE work!");
  bleKeyboard.begin();
}


Starts the BLE service and serial logging.

2. Main Loop
if (bleKeyboard.isConnected()) {
  bleKeyboard.print("Hello world");
  bleKeyboard.write(KEY_RETURN);
  bleKeyboard.write(KEY_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE);
}


Checks if connected.

Sends text, Enter key, and Play/Pause media key.

3. (Optional) Modifier Keys
bleKeyboard.press(KEY_LEFT_CTRL);
bleKeyboard.press(KEY_LEFT_ALT);
bleKeyboard.press(KEY_DELETE);
delay(100);
bleKeyboard.releaseAll();


Demonstrates sending multiple modifier keys (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+Del).

üß™ Example Serial Output
Starting BLE work!
Sending 'Hello world'...
Sending Enter key...
Sending Play/Pause media key...
Waiting 5 seconds...

üß© Future Enhancements

Add GPIO trigger button to send keystrokes manually.

Add custom key sequences from configuration file or serial input.

Extend to BLE Mouse or BLE Gamepad mode.

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

Some key combinations (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+Del) are blocked on Windows for security reasons.

BLE HID may not be supported on some Android versions without user permission.

Works best with ESP32-WROOM, ESP32-S3, or similar boards supporting BLE.

üßë‚Äçüíª Example Use Cases

Wireless automation keyboard

Presentation or media remote

Test keyboard input automation

Security and accessibility tools
